##### typescript support

This plugins supports typescript natively. It uses the installed typescript package, reads the appropriate config, and transpiles to js according to that config. You can see examples on the [`__fixtures__`](./test/__fixtures__) that start with `ts-`.

**Note**: This plugin is compatible with [osls](https://github.com/oss-serverless/serverless) (Serverless v3 fork).

##### individually

This plugins supports bundling functions `individually`. Just use that option accordingly:

```yaml
package:
  individually: true
  excludeDevDependencies: false
```

##### include and exclude

You can use the `include` and `exclude` global, and per-function, configurations and it will include/exclude the especified files/patterns.
